Automatic Brazilian darf calculator and generator (CEI integrated)

We all know the IRS is rubbish and deserves to burn in hell :)

But leaving anger aside, there are some projects on github that propose to automate darf's calculation task, since this useless system is not even capable of doing that, and then complains that we don't pay and that should be the duty of those damned ones to warn. but no, they decide to notify only after that the fine is interest on people's heights...

These are the projects I found related to the automatic generation of DARF on githubThe Federal Revenue Service is garbage and deserved to burn in hell :)

The idea is to compile everything into a single system and make it available to people for free, then we take the opportunity to bankrupt those people who charge for the IR calculator service like mycapital, investor bussola and sencon, among other cursed capitalist services that profit on top of the people using government incompetence as a strategy.

Anyone who wants to help with the project feels welcome, I should play this in my spare time, so it may take a LONG time to get out, even more so that now there are platforms that take care of this very well like IRTrade and the central bank development team is working to make everything more and more integrated, so it may be that in a while this will all become more and more integrated and it won't even be necessary to use a separate platform.
